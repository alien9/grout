# Grout 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/azavea/grout.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/azavea/grout)

Grout is a Django app providing a flexible-schema framework for geospatial data.

Grout combines the flexibility of NoSQL databases with the geospatial muscle of
[PostGIS](http://postgis.org/), allowing you to make migration-free edits to
your database schema while still having access to powerful geospatial queries.
Think NoSQL databases, but with schema validation and PostGIS support.

Grout will help you:

- **Define, edit, and validate schemas** for records in your application
- **Keep track of changes to schemas** using a built-in versioning system
- Perform **fast filtering of user-defined fields**
- Run **complex geospatial queries**, even on records stored with unstructured data

Grout is the core library of the _Grout suite_, a toolkit for easily building
flexible-schema apps on top of Grout. You can use Grout by installing it as an app
in a Django project, or you can deploy it as a [standalone API
server](https://github.com/azavea/grout-server) with an optional [admin
backend](https://github.com/azavea/grout-schema-editor).

For more information on the different ways to use Grout, see [Getting
started](#getting-started).

## Getting started

### Django

If you're developing a Django project, you can install Grout as a Django app and
use it in your project.

#### Requirements

Grout supports the following versions of Python and Django:

- **Python**: 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7
- **Django**: 1.11, 2.0

Certain versions of Django only support certain versions of Python. To ensure
that your Python and Django versions work together, see the Django FAQ: [What
Python version can I use with
Django?](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/faq/install/#what-python-version-can-i-use-with-django)

#### Installation

Install the Grout library from PyPi using `pip`.

```bash
$ pip install grout
```

To use the bleeding-edge version of Grout, install it from GitHub.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:azavea/grout.git
```

Make sure Grout is included in `INSTALLED_APPS` in your project's `settings.py`.

```python
# settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'grout',
)
```

To use Grout as an API server, you need to incorporate the API views into your
`urls.py` file. The following example will include Grout views under the
`/grout` endpoint. 

```python
# urls.py

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^grout/', include('grout.urls'))
]
```

Note that Grout automatically nests views under the `/api/` endpoint, meaning
that the setting above would create URLs like `hostname.com/grout/api/records`.
If you'd prefer Grout views to live under a top-level `/api/` endpoint (like
`hostname.com/api/records`), you can import the Grout `urlpatterns` directly.

```python
# urls.py

from grout import urlpatterns as grout_urlpatterns

urlpatterns = grout_urlpatterns
```

#### Configuration

Grout requires that the `GROUT` configuration variable be defined in your `settings.py` file
in order to work properly. The `GROUT` variable is a dictionary of configuration
directives for the app.

Currently, `'SRID'` is the only required key in the `GROUT` dictionary. `'SRID'` is an integer
corresponding to the [spatial reference
identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system#Identifier)
that Grout should use to store geometries. `4326` is the most common SRID, and
is a good default for projects.

Here's an example configuration for a development project:

```python
# settings.py

# The projection for geometries stored in Grout.
GROUT = { 'SRID': 4326 }
```

Note that Grout uses [Django REST Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
under the hood to provide API endpoints. To configure DRF-specific settings like
authentication, see the [DRF docs](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/).

#### More examples

[Grout Server](https://github.com/azavea/grout-server) is a simple deployment
of a Grout API server designed to be used as a standalone app. It also serves
as a good example of how to incorporate Grout into a Django project, and
includes a preconfigured authentication module to boot. If you're
having trouble installing or configuring Grout in your project, Grout Server
is a good resource for troubleshooting.

### Standalone project

If you're not a Django developer, you can still use Grout as a standalone
API server using the [Grout Server](https://github.com/azavea/grout-server)
project. See the [Grout Server docs](https://github.com/azavea/grout-server)
for details on how to install a Grout Server instance.

## Concepts

### Data model

![The Grout data model centers around Records, each of which has an associated
RecordSchema and RecordType.](./docs/images/grout-data-model.png).

Grout is centered around _Records_, which are just **entities in your database**.
A Record can be any type of thing or event in the world, although Grout is most
useful when your Records have some geospatial and temporal component.

Every Record contains a reference to a _RecordSchema_, which catalogs the
**versioned schema** of the Record that points to it. This schema is stored as
[JSONSchema](http://json-schema.org/), a specification for describing data models in JSON.

Finally, each RecordSchema contains a reference to a _RecordType_, which is
a **simple container for organizing Records**. The RecordType exposes a way to
reliably access a set of Records that represent the same type of thing, even if
they have different schemas. As weâ€™ll see shortly, RecordTypes are useful access
points to Records because RecordSchemas can change at any moment.

### Versioned schemas

In Grout, RecordSchemas are append-only, meaning that they cannot be deleted.
Instead, when you want to change the schema of a Record, you create a new
RecordSchema and update the version attribute.

For a quick example, say that we have a RecordSchema describing data stored on
a `cat` RecordType. The RecordSchema might look something like this:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "next_version": null,
  "schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "title": "Initial Schema",
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
    "properties": {
      "catDetails": {
        "$ref": "#/definitions/driverPosterDetails"
      },
    "definitions": {
      "catDetails": {
        "type": "object",
        "title": "Cat Details",
        "properties": {
          "Name": {
            "type": "string",
            "fieldType": "text",
            "isSearchable": true,
            "propertyOrder": 1
          },
          "Age": {
            "type": "integer",
            "fieldType": "integer",
            "minimum": 0,
            "maximum": 100
            "isSearchable": true,
            "propertyOrder": 2,
          },
          "Color": {
            "type": "string",
            "fieldType": "text",
            "isSearchable": true,
            "propertyOrder": 3
          },
          "Breed": {
            "type": "select",
            "fieldType": "selectlist",
            "enum": [
              "Tabby",
              "Bobtail",
              "Abyssinian"
            ],
            "isSearchable": true,
            "propertyOrder": 4
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A few things to note about this RecordSchema object:

- This is the first version of the schema (its `version` is `1`)
- There is no more recent version than this one (its `next_version` is `null`)
- The schema definition itself is stored as a JSONSchema object on the `schema`
  attribute
- All of the available fields are namespaced by the `catDetails` attribute, which
  we sometimes refer to as a _form_ or _related content_

Now say we want to change the `Age` field to a `Date of Birth` field. Instead of
changing the schema directly, we'll create a new schema. Grout will automatically
set `version: 2` and `next_version: null` for this updated schema:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "next_version": null,
  "schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "title": "Initial Schema",
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
    "properties": {
      "catDetails": {
        "$ref": "#/definitions/driverPosterDetails"
      },
    "definitions": {
      "catDetails": {
        "type": "object",
        "title": "Cat Details",
        "properties": {
          "Name": {
            "type": "string",
            "fieldType": "text",
            "isSearchable": true,
            "propertyOrder": 1
          },
          "Age": {
            "type": "integer",
            "fieldType": "integer",
            "minimum": 0,
            "maximum": 100
            "isSearchable": true,
            "propertyOrder": 2,
          },
          "Date of Birth: {
            "type": "string",
            "format": "datetime",
            "fieldType": "text",
            "isSearchable": true,
            "propertyOrder": 3,
          },
          "Color": {
            "type": "string",
            "fieldType": "text",
            "isSearchable": true,
            "propertyOrder": 4
          },
          "Breed": {
            "type": "select",
            "fieldType": "selectlist",
            "enum": [
              "Tabby",
              "Bobtail",
              "Abyssinian"
            ],
            "isSearchable": true,
            "propertyOrder": 5
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In addition, Grout will update the initial schema to set `next_version: 2`:

{
  "version": 1,
  "next_version": 2,
  "schema": {
    ...
  }
}

Now, when a user searches for Records in the `cat` RecordType, Grout can find
the most recent schema by looking for the RecordSchema where `next_version: null`.
This preserves a full audit trail of the RecordSchema, allowing us to
inspect how the schema has changed over time.

For a closer look at the data model, see the [`models.py` file in the Grout
library](https://github.com/azavea/grout/blob/develop/grout/models.py).

## Developing

These instructions will help you set up a development version of Grout and
contribute changes back upstream.

### Requirements

The Grout development environment is containerized with Docker to ensure similar
environments across platforms. In order to develop with Docker, you need the
following dependencies:

- [Docker CE Engine](https://docs.docker.com/install/) >= 1.13.0 (must be
  compatible with [Docker Compose file v3
  syntax](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#compose-and-docker-compatibility-matrix))
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installation

Clone the repo with git.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:azavea/grout.git
$ cd grout
```

Run the `update` script to set up your development environment.

```bash
$ ./scripts/update
```

### Running tests

Once your environment is up to date, you can use the `scripts/test` script to
run the Grout unit test suite.

```bash
$ ./scripts/test
```

This command will run a matrix of tests for **every supported version of Python and
Django** in the project. If you're developing locally and you just want to run
a subset of the tests, you can specify the version of Python
that you want to use to run tests: 

```bash
# Only run tests for Python 2.7 (this will test Django 1.8).
$ ./scripts/test app py27

# Only run tests for Python 3.7 (this will test Django 2.0).
$ ./scripts/test app py37
```

For a list of available Python versions, see the `envlist` directive in the [`tox.ini`
file](./tox.ini). 

#### Cleaning up

Tox creates a new virtualenv for every combination of Python and Django versions
used by the test suite. In order to clean up stopped containers and
remove these virtualenvs, use the `clean` script:

```bash
$ ./scripts/clean
```

Note that `clean` will remove **all dangling images, stopped containers, and 
unused volumes** on your machine. If you don't want to remove these artifacts,
[view the `clean` script](./scripts/clean) and run only the command that
interests you.

### Making migrations

If you edit the data model in `grout/models.py`, you'll need to create a new
migration for the app. You can use the `django-admin` script in the `scripts`
directory to automatically generate the migration:

```bash
$ ./scripts/django-admin makemigrations
```

Make sure to register the new migrations file with Git:

```bash
$ git add grout/migrations
```
